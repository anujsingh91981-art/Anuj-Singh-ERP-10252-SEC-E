//Explain Compile, Run time error
//Ayush Singh

/*Errors that occur while compiling the program, before execution starts.
These errors are usually due to syntax errors, type mismatches, missing headers, etc. The compiler detects these issues and prevents the program from being executed until they are fixed.

Causes of Compile Time Errors

Syntax mistakes

Missing semicolon ;

Undeclared variables

Wrong function name

Missing header file
*/


 //int a = 10  
// In this line if we forget to put semicolon at the end it will give compile time error




//==================================================================//
//Runtime Errors

/*Errors that occur while the program is running. These 
errors can cause the program to crash or produce incorrect results. 
Runtime errors are often due to 
logical errors in the code, invalid input, or resource limitations.*/

/*
Causes of Run Time Errors

Division by zero
Accessing invalid memory
Infinite loop
Array index out of bounds*/

//eg
//int a = 10, b = 0;
//printf("%d", a / b);
// In this line division by zero will occur which is runtime error
